The Bitwise Utility Tool is a menu-driven C program that performs basic bitwise operations on two integers entered by the user. The program displays a list of bitwise operators and allows the user to choose an operation using a switch-case structure.
This project demonstrates the practical use of bitwise operators such as AND, OR, XOR, Left Shift, and Right Shift. It also helps in understanding how low-level operations work in C programming.
Features
Menu-based user interface
Accepts two integer inputs
Performs bitwise operations:
AND (&)
OR (|)
XOR (^)
Left Shift (<<)
Right Shift (>>)
Uses switch-case control structure
Displays correct result for each operation
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Editor: VS Code
Platform: GitHub
How It Works
The user enters two integers.
A menu of bitwise operations is displayed.
The user selects an operation.
The program applies the selected bitwise operator.
The result is displayed on the screen.
Purpose
This project is designed to strengthen the understanding of bitwise operators and decision-making statements in C. It is suitable for beginners and academic practical submissions.
